# Project Overview

This repository contains five different C++ projects, each demonstrating various programming concepts and techniques.

## 1. operations.cpp
### Description:
This program performs basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It serves as a simple calculator where users can input numbers and an operation type.

### Features:
- Supports integer and floating-point arithmetic.
- Error handling for division by zero.
- User-friendly console input and output.

---

## 2. recite.cpp
### Description:
This program helps users memorize or recite a predefined passage by displaying parts of the text and prompting them to recall the missing words.

### Features:
- Partial text display to encourage memorization.
- User input validation for correct responses.
- Configurable difficulty levels (e.g., more missing words as difficulty increases).

## 3. HeronsFormula.cpp
### Description:
This program calculates the area of a triangle using **Heron's formula**, given the three side lengths.

### Features:
- Uses the formula:  
  \[
  A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
  \]
  where \( s \) is the semi-perimeter:  
  \[
  s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
  \]
- Input validation to ensure valid triangle side lengths.
- Precision handling for floating-point calculations.

## 4. ShortSurvey.cpp
### Description:
A simple interactive program that collects user responses to a short survey and processes the results.

### Features:
- Takes multiple-choice and open-ended responses.
- Stores responses in an array or file for analysis.
- Provides basic summary statistics (e.g., most common answer).

---

## 5. strignname.cpp
### Description:
This program works with string manipulations, possibly including operations such as reversing a string, counting characters, or formatting names.

### Features:
- Handles various string operations (e.g., uppercase/lowercase conversion, concatenation).
- May include a name formatter to standardize name inputs.
- Provides interactive user input and output.

---

## How to Run the Programs
Each program is written in C++ and can be compiled using a standard C++ compiler (e.g., g++ or MSVC).

### Compilation (Example using g++):
```sh
g++ -o operations operations.cpp
./operations
